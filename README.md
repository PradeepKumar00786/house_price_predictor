# house_Price_prediction_model


**Problem statement:**
The goal is to understand the relationship between house features and how these
variables affect the house price.
Using more than one model, predict the price of the house using the given dataset. Please compare the
accuracy of the models along with the drawbacks of each technique's assumptions before recommending
